            <h2>Animal Adoption Website</h2>
            <p>This project features an innovative web application designed to facilitate animal adoption, connecting prospective pet owners with animals in need of a forever home. Developed using <strong>Flask</strong> for the backend and <strong>Oracle SQL</strong> for the database, it ensures efficient user request handling and reliable data management. Key features include a user-friendly interface, detailed animal profiles, advanced search functionality, secure user registration, and a backend admin panel.</p>
            <p>This approach not only showcased my front-end and back-end development skills but also improved the
                application’s data handling efficiency and user experience.</p>

            <h2>Star Simulator</h2>
            <p>Engaged in a collaborative effort with a 3-person team to code a Python-based model simulating the celestial
                arrangement of stars, demonstrating teamwork and coding proficiency.</p>
            <p>Developed in <strong>Python</strong>, this simulator leverages a star database to render the night sky as seen from various parts of the world. It provides an educational tool to explore constellations, star names, and celestial events with accuracy and scientific detail.</p>
            <p>This project deepened my understanding of effective group collaboration, highlighting the significance of
                communication, responsibility sharing, and collective problem-solving.</p>

            <h2>Snake Game</h2>

            <p>A classic Snake game implemented in <strong>Java</strong>. This project was focused on creating a responsive and enjoyable game experience, incorporating features like increasing difficulty levels, score tracking, and intuitive controls.</p>
            <p>This demonstrates advanced object-oriented programming <b>(OOP)</b> skills by developing a dynamic Snake game in
                <b>Java</b>. This project highlighted my ability to leverage OOP principles and API integration to construct a
                sophisticated and robust gaming application</p>

            <h2>Shortest Path Calculator</h2>
            <p>As a C++ assignment, this application calculates the shortest distance between points using coordinates and implements sorting algorithms to optimize pathfinding. It showcases object-oriented programming concepts and efficient data structure usage.</p>
            <p>I learned to manage and integrate effectively different structures of data—for example, stacks and queues—in order to traverse smoothly through the multi-various data sets. It has developed in me the skills of analysis and the ability to apply the most proper sorting algorithms under various conditions, which will lead to optimized solutions of pathfinding. This experience mirrors my dedication not only to achieving mastery in the basic programming concepts but also to practice their application to develop advanced and efficient software solutions.</p>

            <h2>E-commerce System for Computer Products</h2>
            <p>Conducted a comprehensive analysis of an online sales system, leading to the development of a detailed UML
                model that outlined the system’s architecture and interactions.</p>
            <p>Used <b>Oracle SQL</b> to create a robust database solution for managing all aspects of the online sales business,
                from inventory to customer transactions. Developedb <b>PL/SQL functions, triggers and views </b>to automate critical operations and generate dynamic reports, significantly enhancing operational efficiency and decision-making
                capabilities.</p>
